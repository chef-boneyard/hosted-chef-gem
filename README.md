# Hosted Chef: The Gem #

`hosted-chef` downloads your API keys and configuration files from the
[Opscode Management Console](https://manage.opscode.com) and installs
them in the right spot on your system.

## Coming Soon ##
This project is still in preliminary development. Once it ships, you'll
be able to `gem install hosted-chef` and run a script to configure your
system with your Hosted Chef API keys.

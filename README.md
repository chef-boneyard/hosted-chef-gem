# Hosted Chef: The Gem #

`hosted-chef` downloads your API keys and configuration files from the
[Opscode Management Console](https://manage.opscode.com) and installs
them in the right spot on your system.

## Coming Soon ##
This project is still in preliminary development. Once it ships, you'll
be able to `gem install hosted-chef` and run a script to configure your
system with your Hosted Chef API keys.

## Who Should Use This? ##
**DISCLAIMER:** This project is in early stages, so actually no one
should use it yet. The discussion below will become true once the code
is ready.

This utility is designed to reduce friction for users new to Opscode's
Hosted Chef. If you're a Chef pro, or joining an existing Hosted Chef
organization, or running your own Chef server, there's likely little
value for you in this utility.
